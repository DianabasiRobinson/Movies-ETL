# Movies-ETL
Within the scope of the Amazing Prime Hackathon, this project will create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, from Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata and the MovieLens rating data. It then performs the appropriate transformations and loads the data into an existing PostgreSQL database.
For this analysis, we used the following breakdown:

write an ETL function to read three data files,
extract and transform the Wikipedia data,
extract and transform the Kaggle and rating data,
load the data to a PostgreSQL Movie Database.
